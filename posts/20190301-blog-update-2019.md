<p class="lead"><i>"Oops... I did it again. I played with my blog. Got lost in the code."</i></p>

Given my recent experiments with web technologies (see {% post_link electron-blazor %}) I've been meaning to brush up on my web development skills. So this lead me to once again, updating my blog theme.

### Old Stack

So, what do I still have from the {% post_link blog-update-2018 %} post?

- **Hexo** - Hexo is a javascript static content generator, and still awesome.
- **Unsplash** - Unsplash provides high quality, royalty free photos for the blog. I've created several helpers to make adding unsplash images easier.

</section>

... aaaand that's it. I've dumped everything else. New theme, new comment system.

### New Theme

The clean blog theme was ok, but I had to make changes to include things like tags and social media links, which didn't quite fit with the whole theme. So I went looking for a new theme, and found the [Sparkling](https://colorlib.com/wp/themes/sparkling/) Wordpress theme from colorlib. Now the original theme was written for Wordpress, which involves php and I'm not familiar with all the bits of that, so I ended up recreating the theme from scratch.

#### Bootstrap 4

Sparkling used Bootstrap 3, so I decided to learn Bootstrap to re-implement the style for hexo. After about a day I managed to get most of the site done, which was fast for me, given I hadn't done any real HTML+CSS work in a very long time. Woooh boy CSS has changed.

### Comments

This brings us to the biggest reason for all this change, comments. Originally I was using Disqus for comments, but over time I became dissatisfied with that solution and went looking for something lighter. Last year I mentioned Gitment as a system for having comments as GitHub issues, but the problem with that was that you need a GitHub login to comment.

So I decided to switch over to [Staticman](https://staticman.net/). Staticman is web app that will take a form post and turn it into a pull-request on a GitHub project, with the data from the form in a data file in the PR. What this means is comments come in as a new file on the blogs repository, and once approved get included in the source files to generate the blog.

(At some point I want to use GitHub actions to then take the blog, build it, and upload it to the host repository, but right now I don't have access to GitHub actions so that'll have to be a follow up post.)

### 2020 ?

That's it for now. Hopefully things won't change too much over the next year, but who knows. At least it'll give me a reason to write another blog post.
