My partner keeps pointing out that every time I feel like writing a blog post I spend so much time updating the blog code itself that I never actually write a blogpost.

They do have a point. I tend to use updating the blog code as an excuse to not write a blog post. So this time I've decided to combine them by writing a blog post about the technology and updates used in this blog.

### Hexo

Hexo is a static blog generator written in node.js. Being a node app it's easy to grab and runs on multiple platforms. It supports templating and has lots of plugins for adding features to your blog.

### Clean Blog Template

There is an existing hexo version of the clean blog template, but it didn't do what I wanted. So instead I converted it myself. Nice clean design with image headers.

Unsplash is a great source of royalty free high quality photos for my blog. It allow hot linking, and doesn't require attribution, however in my template I do provide attribution where possible. In my template I just have to provide a photo id, and it takes care of the rest. Given the style of blog I wanted, providing high quality images easily and royalty free is wonderful.

### Gitment

Gitment (& Gitmint) is a comment system that uses github issues to track comments. This is amazing. Given this blog is hosted on github gitment makes sense. I used to use disqus, but I've switched completely to gitment now.

And that's it. I want to add more features to this blog, but it's good enough for now. Hopefully now I'll write another post sometime within the next 3 years.
